            <p>
                Our mission is to provide every child with a quality early childhood experience. We strive to create a safe, nurturing and developmentally appropriate environment which fosters children. We believe in empowering children by offering them opportunities to make decisions and solve problems. It is our goal that children will possess confidence in their abilities and establish lasting relationships with teachers and peers. By offering an engaging curriculum it is our aspiration that each child will develop a positive outlook towards school, a better appreciation of the world around them and acquire a life-long love for learning during their time spent at The English Kindergarten.
